imagine waking up to your sibling being missing. he/she has run away overnight. there stuff is still here. the window is wide open. 

<do you go looking for them?
you go outside because your parents have already left for work. you call her/his name while biking through the neighborhood no luck. you go home and wait it out.

v

<or do you wait it out
while your waiting you get a call from a payphone your sibling is on the line. they ask that you dont tell our parents.
suddenly your mom comes in the house looking for her purse. you hang up the phone and cover for your sibling. you jump on the couch and turn on the tv.
your mother asks where your sibling is.what do you tell her

<they are in there room sick
oh no you mom goes in to check on them and sees that they arent there your grounded and so is your sibling when they get back

try again

<they went for a quick stroll
your mother beilved you and left with her purse in hand.

 now your neighbor is asking to borrow your siblings printer which is there room. your
neighbor happens to be a close family friend and know that your sibling doesnt leave home on a saturday when both your parents work. you let them in the room and 
they ask where your sibling is. 

<they are in the basement
your nosey neighbor decides to walk down the stairs to greet your sibling who is not present. they bustyou and your sibling when they get back.
try again


<bathroom
you tell your nosey neighbor that your sibling isnt feeling well and will be in the bathroom for a while.
he then leaves not wanting to get sick.

finally you hear the back door creak open and you see your sibling. they thank you but your mad. they owe you big time for covering for them you tell them what 
happened and they tell you where they were.
